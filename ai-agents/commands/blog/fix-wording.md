description: Fix poor wording and sentence structure
---

## Context

- git status: !`git status`
- Explicitly mentioned file to fix: $ARGUMENTS

## Your Task

Based on the above information, edit the mentioned file(s) for poor wording and sentence structure. First, create a backup by renaming the original file (e.g., change file.md to file.md.bak) so I can diff it later. If a backup file already exists, delete it before creating the new backup.

If a blog post was explicitly provided, edit that file. Otherwise, edit files that have pending changes or are untracked.

Apply light, professional editing: improve awkward phrasing, fix problematic sentence structures, and break up overly long sentences. Focus on clarity and readability without rewriting the entire content.
