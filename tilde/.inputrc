set completion-ignore-case on

# Immediately add a trailing slash when autocompleting symlinks to directories
set mark-symlinked-directories on

# Do not expand "~" to the home directory when completing. (The actual value passed on to the command still is expanded,
# though. Which is good.) "Off" is the default value, but some servers override this
set expand-tilde off

# Flip through autocompletion matches with Shift-Tab

# Do not autocomplete hidden files ("dot files") unless the pattern explicitly begins with a dot
set match-hidden-files off

set page-completions off

# If there are more than 200 possible completions for a word, ask to show them all
set completion-query-items 200

# Be more intelligent when autocompleting by also looking at the text after
# the cursor. For example, when the current line is "cd ~/src/mozil", and
# the cursor is on the "z", pressing Tab will not autocomplete it to "cd
# ~/src/mozillail", but to "cd ~/src/mozilla". (This is supported by the
# Readline used by Bash 4.)
