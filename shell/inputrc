# Autocompletion
#

# Make Tab autocomplete regardless of filename case (cd ~/dow<Tab> => cd ~/Downloads/)
set completion-ignore-case on

# Immediately add a trailing slash when autocompleting symlinks to directories
set mark-symlinked-directories on

# Do not expand "~" to the home directory when completing. (The actual value passed on to the command still is expanded,
# though. Which is good.) "Off" is the default value, but some servers override this
set expand-tilde off

# Flip through autocompletion matches with Shift-Tab
"\e[Z": menu-complete

# Do not autocomplete hidden files ("dot files") unless the pattern explicitly begins with a dot
set match-hidden-files off

# Show all autocomplete results at once
set page-completions off

# If there are more than 200 possible completions for a word, ask to show them all
set completion-query-items 200

# Auto list all TAB possible completions (use instead of TAB-cycling)
set show-all-if-ambiguous on

# Show extra file information when completing, like `ls -F` does
set visible-stats on

# Be more intelligent when autocompleting by also looking at the text after
# the cursor. For example, when the current line is "cd ~/src/mozil", and
# the cursor is on the "z", pressing Tab will not autocomplete it to "cd
# ~/src/mozillail", but to "cd ~/src/mozilla". (This is supported by the
# Readline used by Bash 4.)
set skip-completed-text on

# Use the text that has already been typed as the prefix for searching through
# commands (basically more intelligent Up/Down behavior)

# Allow UTF-8 input and output, instead of showing stuff like $'\0123\0456'
